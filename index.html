        <p>Ever since I remember, I have always loved nature and all the living creatures found within it. I took
          me quite a while to realize that I was meant to be a fighter for those that can't speak. Not only do I feel
          that I have a moral, but also an existential, resposability to do as much as possible to protect what we have
          left in our natural world. </p></td>
